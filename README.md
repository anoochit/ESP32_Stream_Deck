ESP32 Stream Deck
=================

ESP32 Stream Deck is a BLE HID Keyboard. It sent a shotcut key to host (my purpose is switch OBS scene), but you can customize code to control any application by using keyboard shotcut 
eg; sent media keys to control volume, play/pause music or control your mouse.
